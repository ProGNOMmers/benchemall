Preface - [Give me the blood!!!](http://thisshouldlinkdirectlytobenchmarksbelow.com)
------------------------------

My name is Maurizio De Santis, and I work as web developer in Rome. I use Ruby on Rails at work since the 2.2 version.

As a Ruby developer I'm aware about the variety of Ruby application servers, and the difference they do in the publishing of a high-load web app: you could have to buy another couple of servers just for a bad application server choice.

At the moment there's quite a wide list of Ruby application servers used on production environments: [Thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/), [Mongrel](http://mongrel.rubyforge.org), [Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/), [Unicorn](http://unicorn.bogomips.org/), [Puma](http://puma.io/)... each of them with its strengths and weaknesses: easy/pain in the ass to install/configure/maintain, stable, reliable (JRuby platform I'm looking at you), multithreading support (just because multithreading is cool), fast/slow, resources-saver/waster, ... 

Over the years, two of them standed out for features tradeoff: Passenger and Unicorn.

    <tr>
        <td>Installation</td>
        <td>
            <code>gem install passenger && passenger-install-(nginx|apache2)-module</code>, and then you had some options: Passenger was born as a web server module (it didn't even support standalone use), so you had to add the Apache module for using with Apache, or compile it inside Nginx, since Nginx doesn't support modules. Luckily, the Passenger web server module installation script worked like a charm, and I have never got installation problems.

    <tr>
        <td>Configuration</td>
        <td>
            Set up a couple of configuration variables and you were good to go. Just a "little" problem: if you had multiple apps which ran on multiple Ruby versions, you could forget to use it: the Ruby executable config scope was at web server level.
        </td>
        <td>Unicorn configuration was not trivial: you had to configure the application server in order to start the web site properly, configure the web server in order to reverse-proxy the application server and to serve the static files, and customize some Unicorn service init scripts found on Google in order to manage the application server processes. Whoa!</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Maintainance</td>
        <td>
            This was IMHO the worst thing of Passenger: using it with Nginx (as I did), you had to renounce to the package version and the related autoupdates in favour of a compile-and-forget strategy, which can lead to security concerns.

            This was the dark side of Unicorn: how to occupy 500 MB with one single application server? start a Rails app with 10 Unicorn workes, et voil√†!

Passenger VS Unicorn - A comparison - Nowadays

Benchmarks!
-----------

So: when I saw the [link about the Passenger 4.1.0 release on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5661874), I thought "Horray! This is the moment I waited for years! Let's bench'em all (the ones that are interesting to me - which are Passenger, Unicorn and Puma - if you are a fan of other app servers let me know!)!"

Hardware:
CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600K CPU @ 3.40GHz (8 cores)

Ruby 2.0.0p0 (CFLAGS="-march=native -O3 -pipe")
Nginx 1.4.0 (installed and compiled by Passenger)
Passenger 4.0.1
Unicorn 4.6.2
Puma 2.0.1
